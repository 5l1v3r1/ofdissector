Build/Install
=============

Depedencies
-----------
 * glib >= 2.0
 * Wireshark >= 1.4.0
 * SCons >= 2.0

The build requires wireshark include files somewhere on your system.  You can set the
WIRESHARK environment variable to the directory that your include files live in (e.g.
the root of an svn checkout) - this should be such that <epan/packet.h> is a valid
include.

On Linux the build should work out of the box (once you set WIRESHARK), producing
libpacket-openflow.so, which needs to be renamed to openflow.so and moved into an
acceptable wireshark plugin directory (/usr/local/lib/wireshark/plugins/<ver>/ for
example).  

The Windows build should also pretty much work out of the box, provided you have
sufficiently set up your system for building Wireshark itself.

The MacOS X build should work if you've built/installed Wireshark yourself (e.g.
via Brew), which means you'll have all the build dependencies already satisfied.
You will still need to download the source distribution that matches the version
you installed via Brew so that you can run `configure` and generate config.h for
your environment.  Once you have a config.h for your environment, the scons build
should work as it does on any other posix system.

Install
-------
1) cd src/
2) scons install
4) Run wireshark

(`scons install` will work on Linux, but the install target does not work on win32)
